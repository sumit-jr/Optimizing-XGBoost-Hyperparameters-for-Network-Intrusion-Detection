# UNSW-NB15 Dataset

The **UNSW-NB15 dataset** is a modern network intrusion detection dataset created by the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS). It addresses the limitations of older datasets like KDD, providing realistic network traffic with updated attack types.

## Overview

- **Data Collection**: Collected using IXIA PerfectStorm, simulating both normal and malicious network traffic.
- **Attack Categories**: 
  - Fuzzers
  - DoS (Denial of Service)
  - Backdoors
  - Exploits
  - Reconnaissance
  - Shellcode
  - Worms, and more
- **Features**: 49 features, divided into flow, basic, and time-based statistical categories, plus the target label (attack or normal).
- **AUROC**: Achieves **0.922**, indicating strong performance in distinguishing between attack and normal classes.

## Usage

The UNSW-NB15 dataset is ideal for training and evaluating machine learning and deep learning models for network intrusion detection. Its realistic traffic distribution and balanced attack data make it suitable for comprehensive research and benchmarking in intrusion detection systems.
